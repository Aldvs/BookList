# ðŸ“š BookList ðŸ“š
## Simple pet-project "BookList"
### Initially this was my test task and did not carry any purpose. Now this is a pet project on which I am developing in ios development.
### There are three views in the application. The registration, authorization screen and a table view with a list of books. The application also remembers whether the user was logged in earlier.
### Stack:
1. Layout by code (SnapKit)
2. Alamofire + Decodable
3. Storage for user password: KeyChainSwift
4. Cryptography: SHA256 (CryptoKit)

#### API: https://demo.api-platform.com/books?page=1&itemsPerPage=30
